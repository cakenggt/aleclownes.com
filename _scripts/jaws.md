# Themes
* Having to take action. Brody runs away from his problems at first, runs away from violence and aggression, but decides to act after it affects his family.
* Ellen also represents this apsect, where she tells Brody to be careful, and asks if they want to move back to NY. But Brody needs to move away from where she is and be a different force in his family.
* The sea represents the part of himself that Brody is running away from. By running away from the sea, he can run away from the vast store of collective unconscious that contains his aggression.
* There are all sorts of ways of dealing with problems. The mayor is all about protecting the town with appearances. The newspaper owner can move Kitner's ad to the back. But sometimes you need aggression to deal with a problem, and Brody, the person who should be the aggressive one since he is the police, doesn't have it.
* The townspeople are right, you can't just close the beach and hope the shark goes away. There needs to be action.
* Brody tries to research the beast, but he gets overwhelmed. You can't prepare for this battle. It's fine that hooper has a knowledge of it, he doesn't have an aggressive nature to it, like brody must obtain.
* Brody has been running away from this shark his whole life. He even runs away from confronting out of town boaters, he has no aggression.
* Brody starts retreating from his family, internally he begins preparing for the task at hand, and he can only open up to Hooper.
* Quint represents the destructive way of relating to the shark, he will destroy himself if it means destroying the shark. He hates sharks because of what happened to his crewmates, and he makes a job of killing them. He is completely fueled by his hatred of them.
* Hooper is very immature and sees sharks only in the academic sense. He seems to have never killed a shark before, and only views them with awe. But he doesn't have what it takes to destroy the shark.
* Quint and Hooper being on a spectrum, but Brody begins not on the spectrum at all. He has to move onto the spectrum, and then synthesize the two opposites.
* Quint can't kill the shark with pure hatred, it's too smart; and Hooper can't kill the shark with pure admiration, there's no aggression in there; you have to synthesize the two of them.
* Quint uses the rifle from Quint and the scuba tank from Hooper to destroy the shark. He synthesizes both of them, and in the end he takes the shark energy, the aggression, into himself, removing from it the destructive potential. The shark lives on, but in a good man.

# Notes
* Menacing underwater view. Does it always lurk under the surface?
* Why do horror movies always involve sex in some way. Is it because there is a horror in activating those energies?
* "God please help"
* "How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?" "We bought the house in the fall"
* "Those swings are dangerous, stay off them, I haven't fixed them yet"
* The mom says "I think you're gonna live", Brody seems more upset than the mom.
* "What do they usually do, wash up, float up?" Brody has no idea what the season in amity is like.
* "Listen Chief, be careful would you?" "In this town?" Brody moved here BECAUSE it is safe.
* "You mean she ran out on you?" "No sir" Playfully challenging his masculinity.
* When they find the body, Brody looks forlornly to the sea. What could be out there that did this?
* The nine year olds from the school have been karate'ing the picket fences. This is what Brody wants to be dealing with, not the shark.
* Brody is innundated with small town troubles, which is why he moved here.
* Brody does a little skip and looks up at the sky with a smile while he walks into town with the parade in the background. Very Idyllic.
* How unprepared the town is that Brody needs to go into the store to buy signs and paint himself for the closed signs.
* The mayor brings the whole posse of people to convince Brody to not shut down the beaches. Even the examiner is saying that it was a boat propeller. But is the mayor wrong for thinking about the livelihood of Amity? Who makes the real decisions?
* The mayor took the car onto the ferry just to talk to Brody. At the end he says "Alright you can take us back now" after they already got to the other side. Maybe this shows the underhandedness.
* "It's all psychological" the Mayor is concerned with appearances. Look at his crazy suit with anchors on it. But who is concerned with reality.
* "When do I get to become an islander?" "Never, your not born here, you're not an islander, that's it".
* Harry swims up with a grey hat, and scares Brody. "That's some bad hat harry"
* Islander comes up to Brody to complain about people parking in front of their house. Brody is only concerned with watching the water. Looking past the islanders?
* Brody doesn't go in the water.
* The dog is gone. Is this an allusion to how animals disappear when a predator comes, even though the dog was eaten?
* The camera zooms in on Brody when the attack happens. The thing he has been dreading most has just occurred.
* The reporter says that he'll bury the mom's ad as far back in the paper as he can. This shows all the collusion of the town.
* Everyone in the meeting is angry at Brody for wanting to close the beaches. Even when Vaughn says that it's only for 24 hours, someone says that that's like 3 weeks.
* Quint is a person who confronts the problem head on. If you want to ante up, or be on welfare all winter.
* Brody tries to understand them with science through books, but gets overwhelmed with how much people don't know. Is the force unknowable with science?
* Ellen gives him a drink to help him get to sleep.
* "Wanna get drunk and fool around?" Nothing could be further from Brody's mind than sex.
* Mikey loves his present. He's sitting in it. Brody doesn't want his children anywhere near the water.
* "I don't want that to happen, you know that" Brody is afraid that his son will end up just like him, afraid of the water.
* It only takes one look at a painting of a shark biting a boat for Ellen to yell at Mikey too.
* These two nincompoops can't catch the shark, they don't respect it's power. It rips the pier up, because they were unprepared. Compare this with the people all going out in their boats and throwing dynamite into the water.
* "She must have put the ad in field and stream" "More like the national enquirer" This shows how crazy the people coming are.
* Hooper tells the boat people how to get out of their tangle, and then the other boat people won't listen to him.
* "Those eight guys in the fan tail, they're not going to get out of the harbor alive"
* These are your people. "They're not my people, they're from all over" Brody isn't sure where everyone is coming from. Even afterwards he tells the liutenant that he knows their first names and to go talk to them.
* Brody lacks the guts to confront those people.
* Its true, none of these boat people know what they're doing.
* "This was not any boat accident. It wasn't any propeller, or coral reef" Hooper is very angry at their classification.
* "And it wasn't jack the ripper" Hooper doesn't see the shark as a killing machine.
* Everyone is so happy about catching a shark, but Hooper isn't phased, and starts taking measurements. Quint just drives by in his boat, laughing.
* When hooper says that it's a tiger shark, one of the people says "A what?" No one is prepared for this shark event at all.
* Hooper almost gets beat up by the fishermen for saying its the wrong shark. No one wants to listen to him saying it won't be the right one. Even Brody was happy before with the shark capture.
* "A girl got killed last week, and you knew it. You knew it was dangerous, and you let people go swimming anyway." This is Brody's true fear, that he let himself get pushed around by the mayor and everyone else and got someone killed.
* This is the danger of not facing the shark head on.
* "I'm sorry Martin, she's wrong." "No she's not". Brody is taking the guilt and the action into himself.
* When his child copies him, perhaps it shows that he has a family, that he isn't a shark himself. There is a sort of tension between being a man and being an animal, and he has to be both.
* "Give us a kiss" "Why?" "Because I need it" Brody is just a man, and just a father, but he has to become more. Maybe it was good enough to run away from all that violence before, but now he has to evolve again.
* "I'd really like to talk to him" "So would I" Brody is reteating even from his family.
* "How was your day?" "Swell" Hooper can finally break the veneer on Brody because he also experienced with Brody the event at the dock. He is a comrade in sorrow.
* Hooper rediculously takes brody's food and starts eating it. Why? Is it to show how awkward he is? How disconnected from normal life? He did think it was appropriate to tell those fishermen that it wasn't the shark, when any normal person would know that that wasn't the time or the place. Perhaps he is too pure of a scientist.
* Hooper is going to go on a research expedition, so this shark hunt is just exactly like what he would be doing anyway.
* Brody pours himself a tall glass of the wine. Hooper starts to tell him that he wants to let it breathe, but then says nevermind. Hooper really is dense.
* Martin is afraid of water, he will stay in his car when on the ferry. He is afraid of drowning. Maybe he's really afraid of drowning in something else.
* Brody is the one that suggests going to cut the shark open, but Hooper did come over unannounced. It feels like he was fishing for Brody to suggest such a thing, by saying that he would be gone tomorrow and all that.
* "I can do anything, I'm the chief of police" Slowly he becomes more assertive.
* "I'm not drunk enough to go out on a boat" "Yes you are" Hooper reels him into the shark hunt with his pure intellectualism.
* "The crime rate in new york will kill you" "There are so many problems you never feel like you are accomplishing anything" "But in amity one man can make a difference" Maybe Brody wants to make a difference. Maybe he feels like he can't against such violence. The thing he talks about is how there has never been a murder in 25 years in amity. Maybe he feels like he can make a difference if he isn't around violence. Because what is there really to do as a police officer if there isn't crime in amity. Maybe he is scared to do anything.
* "No kidding, want a pretzel" Hooper is not even paying attention to Brody's musings.
* Brody is inquisitive about Hooper's wealth. He seems like a rich playboy.
* "It doesn't make much sense for a man who hates the water to live on an island" "It's only an island if you look at it from the water" Something about perspective.
* "I gotta go down and check the hull" "Why don't we just tow it in" "We will" Brody wants to tread carefully.
* "You don't have the tooth" The mayor latches onto the smallest thing to sow doubt, like it doesn't matter that they've just found another dead person.
* "Sick vandalism" Vaughn wants to bring brody back to the world of petty Amity crime, but now Brody has seen how large the world is, and can't come back.
* "Those proportions are correct" "You'd love to prove that, wouldn't you. Get your name into the national geographic" Vaugn is so ignorant he doesn't know that this isn't even the largest great white. He wouldn't get into the national geographic.
* "There is no need for me to come to brisbane when I have a great white shark right here"
* He yells "What" at his son when he's trying to get his attention when he's on the phone to get shark people to Amity.
* There is a shark killing video game, but getting the shark is nothing like a game.
* They mayor has to go and try to convince people to get in the water.
* "I know it's for the old ladies, but do it for the old man, alright?" Brody is trying everything to keep his family out of danger, even if he doesn't think he can protect the town anymore.
* "We have caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers" Supposedly!?! Something definitely injured people and killed them, but it wasn't that shark. Everything is maybes with Vaughn.
* Their precautions mean nothing when some boys and a cardboard fin could get so close and among the other swimmers. It's a good thing that wasn't the real shark, because no one saw it.
* It's chaos, people are getting trampled, this would have never worked in the case of a real shark. It's comic just how badly this failed.
* "Is everyone there okay, did everyone get out of the water alright?" No, it was a disaster.
* Not even a guard sees the shark go into the pond, it's left up to a hippie painter to warn everyone.
* The place that was supposed to be safe is now the most dangerous place in Amity.
* "Somebody get a gun and shoot it" Brody runs right past and only to his son. He is more concerned about his son than killing the shark.
* Now the tragedy has touched his family, and he can't stay out of it anymore. He tries to stay away from violence and focus on raising his family, but the violence comes for him sooner or later.
* Brody stares out to the open ocean while awe-ing music plays. The great mystery of the ocean.
* "Want me to bring you anything from home" "My cars" "ice cream?" "Coffee" Michael is still such a child, it makes it even more sad. He tries to be a man like his father and go sailing in the boat, but he is only a child still.
* "Want to take him home?" "Home to new york" "No, home here" Brody isn't going to run away this time, he's going to stay and kill that shark. And first he must confront the mayor.
* "My kids were on that beach too" Even Vaughn is terrified of what he had done. He was trying to save the town in his own way, but in doing so he endangered not only his own family but everyone else too. Vaughn's concerns are not immaterial, it will kill the town to lose the summer, so in his own way he's protecting the town as best he can, but he isn't ready for this fight.
* Quint's building is full of shark jaws. This is a hunter, and sharks are his prey.
* He even makes his own alcohol, Quint lives apart from other people.
* "Here's to swimming with bow legged women" Quint is so uncouth, it's like he can't be around other people.
* "Don't drink that" His alcohol is terrible.
* Hooper drank it anyway, but he coughs. He tries to match Quint's manliness, in a juvenile way. Brody isn't trying to match anyone, he is forced to change.
* "I'm talking about finding a great white" "Porkers?" Quint shows that he is already so familiar with them that he has some other name for them.
* "How's that" Quint doesn't even look at the rope, he's trying to discount Hooper as much as he can. When hooper can tie a knot, he goes right on to say that Hooper doesnt' know how to work, because he counts money all his life.
* "You're not going to do this on the ship, are you?" Brody is trying to defuse the situation. He can't understand how anathema these two people are to each other.
* "I'll take him for ballast chief" "You got him" Brody wants hooper on the boat no matter what.
* Quint is listing off his fishing gear, and walks into hooper listing off his scientific gear. This shows a great contrast between the two of them.
* "What are you, some sort of half assed astronaut?" But in the end, it is a combination of Quint's M1 and Hooper's air tank that kill the shark. Both of them are individually not up to the challenge, but Brody, a synthesis of them, is.
* Quint thinks it's crazy that Hooper wants to get in the water with the shark. He can't understand hooper's fascination with the sharks, because he hates them so much.
* Quint is on a revenge streak with this sharking. He's still trying to get revenge for the sinking of his ship.
* Quint goes on a diatribe about girls not being as smart as their grandmothers.
* "That must be quint" "Colorful isn't he" "He scares me" Maybe scary like a shark.
* "Don't use the fireplace in the den, I haven't fixed the flue" Brody is always cognizant of danger, he's always scared.
* Ellen runs away after Brody boards the ship. It's just as salty and uncouth as a stereotypical sailor would be. This is man's work. Brody goes even though Ellen doesn't want him to go because now he must go after the shark, even though he doesn't want to. He must protect his family and his town.
* "If they don't like you going out, they'll love you coming in" He really is just a stereotypical sailor, it's like he has no contact with women at all. He can barely be called a functioning part of society. His resistance to adapting to social norms is very shark like, because sharks are lone feeders.
* The Orca has a shark jaws on it's front. Quint fancies himself the shark of sharks.
* In the beginning they make Brody toss the chum because he is the least experienced on the boat, like in a kind of social heiarchy.
* "Nowadays these kids take out radar sonar electric toothbrushes. Jesus H christ" Quint likes to hunt in the old way, almost how a shark would hunt.
* "Whose driving this boat" "Nobody, the tide" They are integrated with the sea.
* Quint vs Hooper can crushing. While it is funny, it also shows that Quint and Hooper are on a spectrum. A line forms between them, the two ways of relating to sharks. Brody is not on this line, so he cannot be in this interaction. In fact, the next thing he does is almost blow everyone up with the scuba tank.
* "You screw around with these things and they're going to blow up" Even the gear to view the shark is dangerous. Everything is inherently dangerous on this boat.
* "Next time you just ask me which line to pull" A power game between Quint and Hooper.
* Brody is learning the bowline, Quint is teaching him, and Hooper is reading a guide to service his regulator. At this point the shark takes the line.
* Is it significant that the shark takes the line when Brody gets the knot for the first time? I think so, he has now tied his first nautical knot, and has been initiated the smallest amount into the sailors group.
* Quint straps himself to his rod. This is almost suicidal given the size of the shark they are looking for. He wants to battle the shark himself, to the death.
* "He's a smart fish, he's gone under the boat" The shark mirrors the hunters on the surface, under the water. The same in the book, where the shark was under the boat the whole time!
* "I've got something very big" "I don't think so" Hooper doesn't think it's a shark. He says its a tuna or a swordfish. Quint says that he's just supercargo out here, even if he's a big hotshot in the lab.
* "Marlin, stingray, bit through this piano wire? Don't you tell me my business again." Quint is right, Hooper has never fished for shark before, and doesn't know what he's doing or talking about. He purely looks at fish with a sonar and radar, not to catch them, but to examine them. In a way he keeps them at a distance. Whereas Quint is deep in the sharks, he kills them and then boils their jaws.
* "You wealthy college boys don't have the education enough to admit when you're wrong" Hooper is so so immature, he acts like a petulant child. In comparison to Quint, who acts like the saltiest man.
* "What's the point, hooks and lines" Quint is playing a game with the sharks, using the hooks and lines to trick them to the surface where he can get a barrel in them. He battles the fish not only physically but also mentally.
* "Start that chum line again" "Let Hooper take a turn" "Hooper drives the boat chief" This reinforces that Brody is still disconnected from the seamen, but not for long.
* Perhaps the chum is a symbol for the bloody work that is sharking. Brody is getting initiated into it, he is closer to it and therefore closer to the shark when it surfaces. Hooper drives the boat because that is very disconnected from the sharking aspect of it, which he is unsuited for.
* "Stop playing with yourself Hooper" Even though hooper is a sea person, he only has a certain amount of respect by Quint.
* "You're going to need a bigger boat" Brody has now been inducted again into the sailors group. He is the first to see the shark, but only after he followed Quint's orders. Now he has seen the horrors of sharking, which Hooper doesn't understand but Quint does.
* Quint and Hooper start running around, and Brody doesn't know what to do.
* "We're gonna need a bigger boat, right?" "We gotta get to work" Brody is afraid to face the shark, and wants to go back in for more help.
* "Come up front Martin I need you" Now Brody gets to see Hooper's side of things. Hooper goes immediately to try to take a picture, while Quint goes to assemble his harpoon gun.
* You can see when Brody and Hooper go around the side of the boat, Brody has boots on, which are stable, but Hooper has Keds on, which slip. They are also the shoes that kids wear, showing his immaturity. Why is he wearing those shoes when he is on a hardcore fishing boat?
* Hooper tries to get Brody to go to the very end of the boat, and when Brody finds out that its only for a picture, he abandons Hooper. "Foreground my ass!"
* Quint gets contacted by Brody's wife, and he lies to her and cuts off the call. At this point Quint is making a choice to conceal their find, he wants to fight the shark himself, he doesn't want anyone else interfering. Especially the feminine. This is man's work.
* "Come here darling, beautiful" Hooper is completely out of touch with the purpose of the expedition. This is a shark that has killed many people, and he is obsessed with pictures, and calls it darling.
* Brody tries to retreat from Hooper, but Quint comes out with the harpoon gun and Brody has to stop his retreat. Now he is stuck between the two of them, and he is forced onto the line between their two stances.
* "I've never steered a boat in my life" Quint thinks Brody would be best suited for steering the boat now, but it is Hooper that abandons him to get a tracking device.
* "Hooper, hurry up will you" "Your turn Quint" Hooper sees now as the time when Quint can show if he is good at sharking. But actually Quint has been showing his knowledge the whole time, Hooper just won't accept it. But Hooper wouldn't be able to do this part, he's never injured a shark before.
* The tracking device on the barrel shows a synthesis of Quint and Hooper, even though they never use the tracking device to find the shark because the shark is tracking them. In a way, the tracking device comes from the scientific idea of Hooper, that views the shark as something to be sought after and found and studied, whereas the shark is actually the attacker here.
* Hooper yells  out "Time" like he's in a competition to tie the rope. When in fact he's got his hands all tangled up in something that's about to be towed out to sea. He's risking life and limb here, but he sees it as nothing more than a competition.
* Hooper yells to bring another barrel, that he's chasing the shark. But the barrel goes under, just how Quint predicts. Hooper has no idea what he's doing, and he's disappointed.
* Quint seems happy to see Hooper's excitement sour. Hunting sharks is a lot of waiting, not all adventure.
* Even after what happened, Brody still wants to radio in and get a bigger boat.
* Hooper and Quint bond over old battle scars. Brody only has an appendectomy scar, and feels left out. We can see here that, as different as they are, they belong on the same spectrum.
* Hooper gains a  respect for Quint when he finds out he was on the Indianapolis.
* "I'll never put on a life jacket again" His vendetta against the sharks is suicidal, given that his job is to captain a boat, but he won't wear a life jacket. He just assumes he will die on the ocean, and he wants to drown rather than be eaten.
* Again, the shark comes at the moment when they become closer. The shark is driving them together.
* Quint takes out his rifle and starts  shooting at the shark, even though that's very counter productive.
* Brody gets his gun, he's arming up for a battle too.
* The shark has immobilized the boat, now they have to battle it. It's kill or be killed.
* "Quint, if we get close enough, I've got things on board that'll kill him" "Just wanna goose him up, come on" Quint wants to battle the shark, not euthanize it.
* Quint and Hooper work together to bring in the barrel, you see now how they are two sides of the same coin.
* "Where are you going" "I'm going to make a phone call" Brody has had enough with this vendetta. He tries one last time to flee. Even with his emerging energies, Brody isn't ready to take on the shark at this point. He has to be forced into it. He tries one last time, with this call, for a refusal of the call.
* "You're certifiable Quint" Brody has had it up to here with his suicidal hunt. Like the shark, Quint is now forcing him into an inescapable situation.
* Quint shoots the gun from the hip. He's getting into the hunt.
* The water reflecting in the window shows that even Brody is enthralled with the hunt. His bloodlust is coming out.
* "Full throttle, get me right up alongside him" "I can't rev it up that high, it's not going to take it" Here's a point where Hooper is right, Quint is blinded by his bloodlust, which is his undoing.
* "Fast fish" Again, both Hooper and Quint have gotten into the hunt.
* Brody shoots at it, which starts off innefectual, but ends up hitting the shark. Now he can get his licks in.
* "Why don't we start leading the shark into shore instead of him leading us out to sea" Then they both look at Quint. Quint wants the showdown to happen in the ocean, he would never do it close to land.
* Brody tries to help by tying off the rope, but he almost cuts Hooper's legs off. It's just a good thing that the shark wasn't swimming at that moment.
* Quint wants to drag the shark behind the boat, but the boat is too small, the shark can't be killed in such an inglorious way.
* When the boat tips, Brody sees the scuba tanks shift, and now runs to secure them. He knows now what he didn't before.
* Now Quint knows how foolish it was to try to drag the shark. It's going to rip the boat apart.
* They need to disengage from the shark, to let it take the barrels, but they can't untie the ropes because the shark is trying to run. They have bound themselves to the shark.
* "He can't stay on with three barrels in him" "What about us?" Brody understands now that the shark is just as much a danger to them as they are to it. It is truly a fight to the death, on equal ground. "We're going to sink aren't we"
* When the shark goes under with three barrels, Quint is shocked, he can't believe it. Saying that he can't go under with three barrels is like a mantra to him, and now he isn't sure what he's facing. "You ever had one do this before?" "No"
* Brody throws down the pump and tries to climb up with the others on the deck. He is finished being the third wheel.
* "He's chasing us, I don't believe it" The shark is almost mythological at this point.
* "We're going to draw him into the shallow water and drown him. We're heading in Brody" "Thank Christ" Even Quint is spooked by this shark, he knows that he can't battle the shark like this, and opts to use the cowardly way to kill him.
* But Quint doesn't want to battle the shark like that, the dissonance is too much. He destroys his boat's motor, so they have to face the beast in the deep.
* Brody and Hooper look forlorn, knowing that their fate will now be made in this spot. They must kill it, or it will kill them.
* Quint looks around at his broken boat and knows that he has driven himself to this end. This is where all of his vengence has brought him.
* Quint brings out the life jackets because he isn't sure they will win now.
* Quint asks Hooper about his science equipment, because even he knows now that he can't win with brute force alone.
* They have tried Quint's approach, now they will try Hooper's approach.
* "Ain't got no spit" Hooper is scared of the shark for the first time.
* The anti-shark cage was destroyed in one hit. This isnt' a shark, it's a monster.
* Hooper stabs the shark with a knife.
* Hooper has to retreat to the depths as the shark destroys the cage.
* "Bring him up now" Bring him out of the battlefield.
* Theres no time to mourn Hooper, the shark attacks right away.
* By coming out of the water, the shark becomes a danger both in and out of the depths. Nowhere is safe from the shark.
* The air tank rolls onto Quint's hand. This is what causes him to let go and fall into the shark's mouth. Has his disrespect for science finally killed him? Maybe this is a symbol that Quint's approach alone is done.
* Quint doesn't go out without a fight. Even at the end he's stabbing the shark.
* The same air tank that killed Quint is used by Brody. He starts by smacking the shark with it, and ends with throwing it into it's mouth. You can't beat it Quint's way, by bashing it, you have to use the power of science, of curiosity.
* Brody pokes it with a stick. The stick is impotent as an attack towards the shark, he must use Quint's rifle.
* With Quint's rifle and Hooper's tank, Brody finally synthesizes the opposites and takes the shark into himself, destroying it's physical destructive manifestation. This is a true symbol of aggression, the fight for life.
* Quint met the end he was destined for that day in the navy. He lived by the shark, and he died by the shark.
* "Can we get in on those?" Brody is finally alive, and his idea will bring them into shore.
* "I think the tide's with us" "Keep kicking" Brody is at one with the ocean.
* "I used to hate the water" "I can't imagine why" Brody has now taken the shark into himself. Notice how he didn't have to take more sea sickness medicine after the beginning. He was transforming the entire time, and now the transformation is complete. Even after this harrowing experience, he says that he "used" to hate the water.

These are not invalid desires, it is their responsibility to protect the town in their own way as well, and they are right, the town will starve that winter if they lose the summer dollars. But their indirect defenses can't protect the town, someone has to go out and kill the shark.
    * Brody wants to shut down the beaches and just wait for the shark to go away, but a town's police chief is supposed to proactively protect it from threats, not run away. The townsfolk are right when they say that shutting down the beaches isn't good enough.
* Quint
    * A loner, like a shark. He has no social ability, he's misogynistic and uncouth.
    * He thinks of himself as a shark to sharks, as evidenced by the jaws on the Orca.
    * He is so bent on revenge that it becomes suicidal.
    * He hates the fishing technology, maybe it takes away from his feeling like it is a battle between shark and him, which reduces the revenge.
    * Straps himself to the rod, even though he knows it may be a several ton shark.
    * Prevents them radioing in for help so he can face the shark. The shark has immobilized the boat, but Quint destroys the radio so they can't get help. They have worked together to create an inescapable situation.
    * Lives by the shark, dies by the shark.
* Hooper
    * Also no social skills.
    * "Come here darling, beautiful!" He is completely out of touch with the expedition, to kill a shark that has killed many people.
    * He loves sharks and dismisses their danger. In a way he has removed himself from the sharks in order to study them.
    * He also acts like a child.
    * "Time!" This is nothing more than an academic endeavor to him.
    * Since he never defined his life as a battle with the shark, he is spared and survives using his science equipment.
* The spectrum between Quint and Hooper
    * Talk about the symbolic meaning of the two points on the spectrum, instead of them as characters.
    * Can crushing scene.
    * Quint and hooper both discount each other's contributions. Quint makes him tie a knot and then dismisses it, hooper acts like quint is unintelligent "Don't you tell me my business again".
    * Both witnessed the destructive power of sharks in their youth, but Hooper loves the sharks because of it, while Quint hates them.
    * Quint never escaped from those shark infested waters, he's still fighting the sharks. He became a shark, to prey on them the way they preyed on his crewmates. Hooper has been admiring sharks from a distance since that day as well, and he's unable to go back and experience the shark physically.
    * Between hate and love, between experience and understanding.
* The process of synthesis
    * In the beginning, Brody is completely outside the spectrum between Quint and Hooper. He hates water, and even on the boat, is made to throw chum.
    * Almost breaks the scuba tank. Now brody is in a situation where everything is dangerous.
    * Tying the knot is the first step of approaching the synthesis.
    * The shark always attacks after Brody becomes more interwoven with the sailors life. When he ties the bowline, when he is chumming, when they all bond over singing.
    * "Hooper drives the boat chief"
    * Brody becomes acquainted with the bloody work of sharking by chumming, which is why the shark comes.
    * The path isn't straight, Brody tries to go back at every opportunity, and is forced into further situations of development. At times he's bounced back and forth between Quint and Hooper, like when he retreats from the front of the boat just to find Quint coming from the back with the harpoon.
    * Brody gets more aggressive throughout the movie. First he says he wont run away to NY, then he insists on going on the voyage, gets his gun, shoots his gun.
    * When Brody hits the shark, he is now on the attack.
    * When the boat tips, Brody runs to secure the scuba tanks. He is now knowledgeable.
    * Even though its important to advance towards your shadow, towards the aggression, you still have to synthesize the opposites to integrate it.
    * The first inkling of a synthesis comes with Quint asks Hooper what his science equipment can do. We see the distance between the two of them close, which makes synthesis more manageable. Quint is open to using equiment, and Hooper is open to killing the shark himself.
    * At first the shark could always be counted on to be under the water, and the people above the water, but when the shark leaps onto the boat, and the boat starts sinking, that boundary is violated, and Brody must synthesize or die.
    * With Quint's rifle and Hooper's tank, Brody finally synthesizes the opposites and takes the shark into himself, destroying it's physical destructive manifestation. This is a true positive symbol of aggression, the fight for life.
    * "Can we get in on those?" "I used to hate the water" Brody is now the master of aggression, and uses it as a life force. There is nothing left to fear.

# Jaws

## The Hero's Journey

In "The Hero's Journey", Joseph Campbell introduces the concept of the monomyth, an overarching plot pattern that many stories across the world and throughout history adhere to. He makes the case that the monomyth's prevalence is due to it mirroring a psychic process inherent in all people, the process that Carl Jung called Individuation. In this process, neglected parts of a person's personality have to be reckoned with and ultimately integrated into the larger personality. During the monomyth, the hero ususally has to go on a journey. This journey exposes them to a mythical world, and additionally introduces them to an antagonistic force. As the story progresses, the hero learns to master the mythical world, and in so doing, defeats the antagonist. The hero finally returns to the mudane world, but changed from the experience. Similarly, in the individuation process, a person's normal world is disrupted for some reason or another, making the status quo unsustainable. They are then thrust into conflict with a neglected part of their personality, which can manifest in a shadow, or negative form. Eventually the neglected part is integrated into their larger personality and they can return to the world they were used to. This mirroring between story beats and psychological processes gives us a useful lens through which to analyze popular media, as its sometimes this mirroring that makes us attached to a particular work of art. Today we'll be analyzing the movie Jaws through this lens, and seeing what it has to say about our relationship with aggression.

## Brody

As the main character, Police Chief Martin Brody serves as the subject in need of individuation, or similarly, the hero in the hero's journey. From the first scene in which he's introduced, we can see that he's a fearful man. He's afraid of asserting himself. *Scene where he asks the mayor if he'll take responsibility* He overreacts to the smallest danger. *Hand cut on the swings* And he's afraid of violence. *new york city crime* Brody fled New York City, and its problems, to come to the peaceful tourist town of Amity. *no murder in 25 years* Brody tries to convince himself that being free from crime will allow him to make a real difference in the town, but what kind of impact can a police officer have in a town where there's no crime to stop. One can imagine Amity as the final assignment of an officer on the verge of retirement, not the goal of a police chief in his prime. As a man afraid of the water, by moving to an island he's backed himself into a corner, and the only way out is out to sea.

The ocean oftentimes serves as a powerful symbol for the unconscious, those parts of ourselves that that we cannot or will not understand. Those dark depths play home to the leviathans of our heart, such as moby dick or the kraken. But the enduring myth of Atlantis shows that we believe an enlightenment can also be found there, if we would only venture forth. We can interpret Brody's fear of the water as a reluctance to explore what might be in those depths, the depths of his unconscious. But as we'll soon see, if he won't go to it, the terror will come to him.

## Ellen

Ellen is Brody's wife, and as the person who shares a house with him, is very similar to him in terms of fear. In the same scene where Brody's son shows Ellen that he cut his hand, we can see the difference in their reactions, with Ellen being much calmer. Shortly afterward though, we see Ellen tell Brody to be careful as he leaves to go into work. *This town?* Ellen provides an opportunity to preview Brody's mindset about their new community, a mindset that he later expounds on to Hooper. Since its Brody who goes on the journey in this story, Ellen can serve as a reminder of where Brody began. After the shark attack on the beach, when Ellen floats the idea of moving back to New York City, Brody declines. By contrasting Ellen and Brody's reactions, we can see a transformation in Brody even at this early point in the film.

## The Shark

If a part of the personality is neglected enough, it can reemerge in a shadow form, which acts destructively towards a person. In the book "Jaws", by Peter Benchley, it's revealed that while Quint, Brody and Hooper are out on the boat, unable to find the shark, the shark is surprisingly stalking the boat directly beneath them. The shark in this story is the shadow form of Brody's own aggression, which he can't handle or understand. Brody's been running away from his own aggression his whole life: he ran away from policing in New York City, he runs away from confronting the alien fishermen descending upon the town, and he even runs away from dealing with the shark attacks while they're happening. But this shark will always come for him in the end, it's his shark. It takes the imminent destruction of the town that his family has made a home, the town that he's supposed to protect, to finally force him to confront the unconfrontable.

## The Mayor

*Scene were they gang up on Brody* As an islander, or a person who lives in Amity year-round, and as a leader in the community, Mayor Vaugn has a real need and desire to keep the town safe. *my kids were there too* As he reminds us, his kids were on the beach when the shark attacked. While it's easy to view the mayor as nothing more than an impediment to Brody's journey, in fact he too acts as a fixed point with which we can measure Brody's transformation. *summer town, summer dollars* He's not wrong, closing the beach will certainly doom the town to welfare the next winter, and it may never recover at all. In the beginning, his and Brody's wants regarding dealing with the shark are one in the same, they both hope the shark will just go away, even after Quint's warning at the town meeting. *Supposedly injured some bathers* While Brody's afraid of personally confronting the shark, Mayor Vaughn's desire is more plain: admitting the existence of a man-eating shark in your tourist town will undoubtedly hurt it's economy. But the shark won't just go away, and after he realizes that, its Brody who has to evolve past that fear, in order to save the town.

## Quint

In order to destroy the shark, Brody must face his fear of the water and take to the open ocean on a fishing expedition. The fisherman he hires is Quint, the same one that warned the council after the attack on the beach. Quint is just about as stereotypical a salty fisherman as you can find. He has no manners and is uninterested in anything that isn't sharking. In fact, his cabin walls are completely covered in mounted shark jaws. He eschews help, and only begrudgingly takes Brody on the voyage after Brody holds the payment over his head. Later on, we learn that he was one of the survivors of the doomed USS Indianapolis, which lost most of it's crew to shark attacks. This revelation reframes Quint's obsession with sharks. He hates the sharks, and takes pleasure in killing them, getting revenge for his lost brothers in arms. In the book, when they catch a blue shark, Quint cuts it's belly open and lets it go, taking delight while watching it eat itself. His singleminded crusade has made him a shark of sharks, even going so far as to put a shark jaw on the front of his ship, the orca, named after the killer whale thats known to playfully kill sharks. We can see how suicidally obsessed he gets in the hunt: strapping himself to the fishing pole when a potentially multi-ton shark is on the line, and destroying the radio to prevent Brody from calling for help. His terrible vendetta against the shark has transformed him into what he hates, a machine of death. But ultimately, if you live by the shark, you die by the shark, and Quint succumbs to the fate predestined him since that day in the pacific.

## Hooper

Hooper, on the other hand, relates in the opposite way to sharks. *story about eating boat* Ever since this experience watching a shark eat his boat, Hooper's been in love with them. But only at a distance, Hooper loves sharks in a very academic sense. *beautiful* Hooper is unable to see the dangerous nature of the shark, by keeping them at a distance he can separate the idea of the shark from the actual shark. Regarding real experience close up with sharks, Quint has him beat. If Quint is the salty old man, we can think of Hooper as the idealistic and naive child. This expedition is a game to him. *Why would I go to australia, when I've got a great white here* We can see this most clearly when, after waiting until the last minute to begin tying a barrel onto Quint's harpoon, he finishes the knot without a second to spare. *Time!* He still thinks he's in one of his boat races, trying to win a prize. But the prize on Quint's boat is not having your fingers torn out by the rope, not being eaten by a shark. After his ill-advised turn in the shark cage, Hooper again swims away from a shark to safety. It's this detachment from the shark that prevents him from harming it, and allows him to live through the experience, where Quint was unable to avoid his violent end.

## The Spectrum of Sharks

Quint and Hooper represent two opposing ends of the spectrum of how to relate to sharks. Both of them had an experience involving sharks in the past thats defined their personalities. Quint's has turned him into a person so full of hate and vengeance that he more resembles a shark than a man. Hooper's has filled him with an infatuation that at the same time has kept him distanced from both the objects of his desire, as well as other people around him. *takes brody's food* These two men don't play well together, they can't help but pick at each other's deficits. Quint berates Hooper for his lack of experience crewing a ship, and Hooper thinks Quint is an unintelligent fisherman. But between these two points, between hate and love, experience and knowledge, there's a way forward, a way to face the shark.

## Synthesis

At the beginning of the film, Brody is completely outside the spectrum between Hooper and Quint. His fear of the water betrays a deep insecurity with his aggression, which is eventually manifested in the shark that stalks his town. Even when he finally decides to go on the boat, he's made to throw chum, to him the most demeaning job on board. But it's a necessary task, not for luring the shark, the shark is already with them, but for Brody to become acquainted with the bloody work to come. On the boat he's surrounded by danger, just by pulling the wrong knot he nearly blows up the boat with compressed air. For the safety-loving Brody, we can't imagine a worse location. But bit by bit, he becomes more familiar with the sea-going world, eventually learning how to tie a bowline knot. It's at this point the skark first makes itself known. *I got it!* We can see a pattern emerge, every time Brody becomes further initiated with the sea and approaches the place where Quint and Hooper are, the shark comes onto the scene. The second time the shark approaches, Brody is once again chumming, but he's much saltier about it. As Brody is more able to handle his naiscent aggression, the shark makes further appearances. But that doesn't mean the path is straight, many times Brody tries to turn back from further development *brody tries to go to the back of the boat* but is prevented. When Brody tries to make the ultimate takeback by radioing-in to the mainland for help, Quint destroys the radio, putting Brody in a position where he has to advance, or die.

But Brody has been advancing. At first afraid to acknowledge the existence of the shark, he then forces the mayor to sign the order hiring Quint. When he was afraid to get on Hooper's boat, he then forces Quint to take Hooper and himself on the voyage. And where he was afraid to battle the crime of New York, he now takes aim directly at the shark, the menace to his adopted hometown. By bloodying the shark, he's now fully committed to the battle. We can see this progression again when the boat tips to the side: we see Brody scramble to secure the same air tanks he previously knocked down. But becoming more agressive isn't Brody's only task, he also has to synthesize the two poles of aggression represented by Hooper and Quint.

*You're gonna burn out the engine* After the engine's been destroyed by Quint's suicidal need to battle the shark on his own terms, Quint asks Hooper about his science equipment, and if they can use it to kill the shark. Where he previously mocked Hooper for all his equipment, he now reaches out to Hooper for a solution, bringing the two opposing poles closer together for Brody. *pulling up the cage* With Hooper's cage destroyed and Hooper missing, Brody can see that neither Quint nor Hooper's approaches alone can destroy the shark.

With all these elements in close proximity, and the need for a new approach made clear, the shark attacks! Up to this point we could always count on two things, Brody won't go in the water and the shark won't come out. But now the shark has crossed the barrier between the unconscious and the conscious, and Brody is sinking into the deep. In this last moment, when all is almost lost, Brody must integrate the shark, or die in the attempt. But what does Brody need from the shark? If the shark, with its rampage of death and destruction, represents the negative side of aggression, then the fight for the preservation of life represents the positive. With the combination of Quint's rifle and Hooper's air tank, Brody finally combines the opposites and gains access to the positive form of aggression. Ultimately, he conquers his stalking shadow by taking it into himself.

I think Jaws can tell us a lot about ourselves and our place in the world. We often think about human attributes like aggression as completely negative, that they have no place in our society. But we often overlook the positive aspects of these attributes, and how they've allowed us to advance as a people. Any part of our nature we try to suppress will only come back to haunt us as the worst version of itself. It pays to sit down and do the work, the great work, in understanding all the aspects of a thing, instead of trying to throw it away. Only when we understand and accept these parts of ourselves can we be all we're meant to be. Like Brody, we can then swim through the water of life, unafraid of what lies below. *you know, I used to be afraid of the water*
