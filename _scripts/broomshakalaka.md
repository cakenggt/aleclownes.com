* end basketball games or *marriages* with similar ease
* murdered parents and children
* Who am i? (is this an allusion to him being similar to time?)
* former father
* now over the next... 10 minutes (doesn't know what time it is)
* Mark: Holy shit (when the blower comes out of the broom)
* I used to have a daughter, so i know how important safety is.
* The garden edger's safety sensor will shut it down if anything comes within a dick-width of the blade (has his incompetence killed his daughter?)
* It's heavier than you think
* Is this frosting? No, it's a caulk gun (things not being as they seem) (The broomshakalaka is also not as it seems, so is Denny's presentation)
* Say, time is bleeding up (another time reference)
* I asked for a banana. That is a banana. (another thing that isn't as it seems)
* Circumcision knife (why is he so obsessed with judaism?)
* 2550 brooms
* She was decapitated, not by the broomshakalaka, by jihadists (is this even true?) **He is enacting the same thing that killed his daughter to bring her back. Very symbolic. By killing himself with the broomshakalaka, he hopes to bring her back**
* Those were her ashes we spread earlier (this is even more like a ritual, he has brought the body to the studio)
* This is old broom. No this is broomshakalaka (he again can't tell things)
* You're killing him
* I too understand the pain of losing someone you love. (the belief is spreading)

* The torah forbids making marks on your flesh.
* What have I done, stop buying the broomshakalaka (he's now the only one who doesn't believe, and he fights against it)
* It worked! And if you buy more, we can save denny too!
* We can save everyone (Getting very close to a religion)
* Don't think, just believe, and sell!
* You're back! And so are my hands! (something about stigmata?)
* I can't pretend to understand what happened here today.
* If you've ever wanted a second chance to reclaim what's important in your life.
* French Fry!

* Three believers, three miracles

# Outline
## The power of belief
* Nothing is as it seems
    * This isn't frosting, it's a caulk gun.
    * This isn't the broomshakalaka, it's old broom.
    * This isn't an infomercial, it's a ritual. (contrast the beginning of the infomercial with the scene before Jenny comes back)
        * Infomercials always try to convince us that life will be better with this product, that the product is amazing. (Show clips from rotisserie chicken and ninja bullet) But this product really is amazing, even the hosts can't believe what their seeing. But this belief is neccesary for the true purpose of the infomercial.
* The ritual
    * Denny has clearly accidentally killed his daughter in some broomshakalaka accident. He hopes to bring her back to life through the symbolic saving of time.
    * What are the components of this ritual?
        * The body: The ashes in the beginning of the infomercial were Jenny's ashes, which were scattered.
        * The reenactment: Denny proceeds to kill himself through the infomercial, even going so far as to deliver the fatal blow with a normal broom, which should be impossible. This man is bent on dying during the infomercial.
        * The exchange of time: By saving the people of the world 11,220 days, this time can be exchanged for a life.
* The power of belief
    * In the beginning of the infomercial, we start out with one believer and two bewildered actors. Denny knows what he wants, within the next 10 minutes, he will be dead and the ritual will be complete, bringing back Jenny.
    * As the infomercial goes on, Eileen connects with his loss, and begins to believe too. She ups the sell quota to include her dog, french fry.
    * By the end of the infomercial, Jenny having been brought back to life and Eileen exchanging her wish for french fry for bringing back Denny, Mark has suffered a break with his understood world. He can't understand what is happening, but by the end, he believes too. And with the third believer, comes the third miracle, and french fry is restored.
* Conclusion
    * Faith and belief are important to all people, but we have to be careful of externalizing our own internal symbols. In the next video, we'll look at the "Book of Christ" infomercial, which deals with the dangers of externalized symbols.

# Broomshakalaka: The Power of Belief

In this infomercial, we are introduced to the Broomshakalaka, the best broom multi-tool money can buy. But as this infomercial digresses, we can see that nothing is as it seems. This isn't a frosting dispenser, it's a caulk gun. This isn't broomshakalaka, it's old broom. *play clip of old broom* And this isn't an infomercial, it's a ritual. *contrast the beginning of the infomercial with the scene before Jenny comes back* The purpose of an infomercial is to convince the viewers over an extended period of time that the stated product is amazing, and the viewers' life will be better with it. *rotisserie chicken and ninja bullet* But the broomshakalaka really is amazing, *oh shit* even the paid actors can't believe what their seeing. But this very belief is necessary for the true purpose of the infomercial.
## The Ritual
*Denny talking about how Jenny was beheaded*
Denny, contrary to his protestations, has clearly killed his daughter, Jenny, in a broomshakalaka accident. Now we see why he is so obsessed with turning back time. He seeks to make this symbolic "saved time" a component in a ritual meant to bring his daughter back to life. But what are the components of this ritual?
### 1. The Body
In the beginning of the infomercial, Eileen purposefully drops a bowl of ashes on the floor so Denny can demonstrate the broomshakalaka's industrial grade blower. We later find out that these were Jenny's ashes, and that he has symbolically scattered them in the studio.
### 2. Reenactment
As Jenny was decapitated by the broomshakalaka, we similarly see Denny dismember himself during the course of the infomercial. These gruesome events are seemingly accidental, but when given a normal broom to work with while Mark and Eileen finish up the infomercial, Denny somehow lethally impales himself. Suddenly these accidents don't seem so accidental at all, this man is trying to kill himself before his infomercial is over. Through reenactment, we are brought even closer to that fated moment where Jenny was stolen away.
### 3. The Exchange
When queried about his obsession with selling 2,550 broomshakalakas, Denny reveals that the combined time saved with that number of units is equal to the span of one human life. Jenny's life, to be specific. *It's math, it's not magic* Mark's insistence that such an exchange is symbolic only doesn't seem to phase Denny in the least.
## The Power of Belief
As the infomercial begins, we have one believer and two bewildered actors. Denny knows what he wants: in 10 minutes he will be dead, the ritual will be complete, and Jenny will have been brought back to life. No one in the studio knows this, only he has faith in the broomshakalaka. As the infomercial goes on though, Eileen begins to believe as well, touched by the hope that the broomshakalaka can make what's wrong right again. She ups the total to 5100 brooms to bring back her beloved dog, french fry. At the end of the infomercial, Jenny and Denny having been brought back to life, Mark is forced to confront his disbelief. He admits to the audience that he can't hope to understand what he's seen, but now he believes too. With the third believer comes the third miracle, and french fry is restored.
# Conclusion
By poking fun at the outrageous claims in advertising, Broomshakalaka has exposed the desires we all have in our hearts that these commercials speak to: the hope for change, and a wish to be made whole. The journey of Denny, Mark, and Eileen is one we hope for in our own lives. We believe that this journey is possible, and that belief is required to complete the journey. Next time, we'll be exploring another infomercial, and what it has to say about the destructive power of externalizing these needs.
