Notes:
* Prof. Edelman, Rev. Fryer, Dr. Crowley, Chef Tomas
* Some of the books in the intro aren't even "great" books, like mein kampf and dianetics. Can we trust these people?
* "Dear bible, ive never told anyone this before" reads more like a diary entry.
* "Son of god, and now published author." Some of these things are way more important than the others.
* Pastor of a megachurch, suspended professor, and archaeologist at a school of music and dance
* "Much richer character than the cornball christ" Does this man even like Jesus? How can he be a professor (of theology?) (suspended) when he has such negative opinions on the religion.
* "on this live television event we reveal..." Sounds like those history channel shows where they say "we'll discover if the loch ness monster is real". It feels fake and overpromising in the same way. And you never find out anything interesting anyway.
* Everything about the book's discovery is suspect. Why was it discovered under a sbarro? Can the chain of evidence from these greek shipping magnates be trusted? Especially when people were fooled by jesus's sunglasses.
* Jesus's sunglasses show how "blind" everyone is, to be fooled by them.
* "after careful study... was found to be authentic" Study by the infomercial hosts, or people associated with the infomercial? I think so, since it is first being revealed here. This is not trustworthy.
* What is the obsession with finding new artifacts of Jesus? like the shroud of turin, why is it so important to prove it? Is it due to externalization? Maybe this is a whole commentary on people trying to find "proof", or something more?
* Noble god for noble gasses.
* Prof: "Unlike the bible designed to be misunderstood to justify abhorrent practices." Huh? Also, the book of christ is WAY worse.
* "Full of useful information", No it isn't these recipes suck.
* The chef is the person so far with the best background for this, and he was just a former vatican chef, but he's able to see that the argon is killing them.
* "I have faith that god would have wanted this much lemon" Why does he have faith in this?!?
* Why does jesus love lemons so much? The lemons are a great symbol that the new stuff is awful. Just because it's new, doesn't mean its good.
* Jesus kills someone in a hit and run, and lets his follower die for it. Why do these people want to believe in all this awful new stuff more than the old stuff.
* Jesus gets obsessed with a lizard collectible card game.
* "Jesus was writing in a different era, but even then he was considered deeply misogynistic"
* This book has so many current day events in it: hit and run's, collectible card games, pick up artists. This throws into question the authenticity of it.
* "That's just good advice" says the reverend. Then he starts talking pick up artist science. A reverend should not be talking this way.
* The chef was at lake Nyos in 1986, so he knows about gas poisoning. He's telling them what is happening, but they aren't listening to him, they are even showering in the argon. Notice the argon sprayer people have gas suits on, because they know the danger.
* "If anything we should be breathing more argon"
* "Cough not unto your hand, for it is an abomination unto god, even worse than abortion" This is another achronicity, since the bible doesn't list abortion as an atrocity.
* "Cough signature" This is exactly the kind of rediculous quasi-science that these kinds of programs use. This is crazy, science doesn't work like this.

* Loch ness monster
    * Side scanning sonar, and what did they find? Stop.
* Book of christ
    * Now having been authenticated by experts, what does this new book of the bible reveal? Stop.
* Virginia
* What would you find behind that veil? Is it the remnants of a scroll buried under a bombed out sbarro? No. Is it the clear and crisp sonar profile of an ancient plesiosaur? No.
* These things are of the mundane world, and to invest them with the divine energy commands a steep price.
* By taking the book of christ as gospel, they are led by the nose on a wild ride through pickup culture, hit and runs, and terrible recipes.
* Where did that lead them? Christ's digitally reconstructed cough plays as a dirge while the presenters die of argon poisoning.

* "You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could tear apart."

When I was a child, I spent the summers at my grandparents' house. My grandpa loved the history channel, so I ended up watching a lot of history channel shows. One I remember very well was an expos√© on the Loch Ness Monster. I remember that at the beginning of the program, they talked about all of the new science they were using, and teased that they would prove if the Loch Ness Monster was real by the end. My eyes were glued to the television, I didn't let my grandparents change the channel, even during commercials, in fear of missing the big reveal. They deployed boats with sophisticated sonar to scour the Loch, and what did they find? Stop.
The Book of Christ is a similar program, where for the first time, a new book of the bible, authored by Christ himself, would be revealed on national television. In the second intefada, Hamas bombed a Sbarro pizza restaurant, where an ancient scroll was found. After a long and winding route through the mediterranian, changing hands between various Greek shipping magnates, the scroll is authenticated by theological experts. What does this new book of the bible reveal? Stop.
In 1897, an 8 year old child named Virginia O'Hanlon wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Sun asking if Santa Claus was real. In response, the editor writes about the power of belief, the spirit of Christmas, and includes the following passage:
"You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could tear apart."
What would you find behind that veil? Is it the remnants of a scroll buried under a bombed out sbarro? No. Is it the clear and crisp sonar profile of an ancient plesiosaur? No. These things are of the mundane world, and are unfit to represent the larger mysteries of life.
But what if that energy is mistakenly invested into these mudane objects? You can see the result in this infomercial. By treating the Book of Christ as gospel, our hosts are led on a wild ride through pickup artist culture, midnight hit and runs, and truly terrible citrus based recipes "from God's mouth to your plate." Where has this investiture ended up? Christ's digitally reconstructed cough plays a dirge while the presenters die of argon poisoning.

Book of Christ: A Symbol with no Meaning
* Virginia intro
* You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.
* Explain about how santa claus is a symbol for the unseen world of meaning, and because peace and good will to men exist, then Santa Claus must exist too as their symbol.
* Intro on Book of Christ.
* Disconnected from modern Christianity "cornball christ" so it exists as a symbol with no meaning.
* Like a magnetic monopole, a symbol with no meaning cannot exist for long in the real world. We are only able to examine this symbol with no meaning in the theoretical environment of this infomercial.
* A symbol with no meaning stands only for itself, it sucks up all the meaning around it like a black hole.
* Because it has no external meaning, everything in it is literal, and means only itself. The recipes are only bad over-citrused recipes. The pickup artist chapter only means that *terribly misogynist*.
* We can see our hosts ironically turn into idolaters of the book. Since the book only stands for itself, it is that that they worship.
* To various degrees, the hosts are sucked into the meaninglessness of the book *compare all the hosts with the tilapia*
* In the end, our hosts have sacrificed themselves to their dark god, a symbol with no meaning.

In 1897, an 8 year old child named Virginia O'Hanlon wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Sun asking if Santa Claus was real. In response, the editor writes about the power of belief, the spirit of Christmas, and includes the following passage:
"You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding."

What this editor is saying is that Santa Claus is a symbol of the hidden world of meaning, which is much larger than Kris Kingle himself. Charity, hope, peace, and good will toward men are all etherial concepts that can be hard to grasp as they are. But Santa Claus provides a symbol anchored to these meanings, helping us represent and define the spirit of Christmas. This is the power of symbols, everyone *knows* how Christmas makes them feel in their hearts, even if we can't quite pin it down with words. But whenever you see that jolly man with a bottle of coke on a sleigh, somehow those feelings always come rushing back. By insisting that Santa Claus exists, the editor is really talking about the power of the things he represents. Those, he insists, will make glad the heart of childhood for ten times ten thousand years.

In the second intefada, an ancient scroll was discovered in the rubble of a bombed out Sbarro. After a series of acquisitions, double crosses, and hostile takeovers by greek shipping magnates, the scroll was authenticated by theological experts to be the Book of Christ, the only book of the bible written by Jesus himself. So begins the program introducing this theological discovery to the world for the first time. Our three hosts are some of the least qualified people you could find for this presentation.

It turns out that the qualified need not apply, as the document is laughably non-canonical to modern Christianity. *cornball christ* In it we find a confession of a hit and run, descriptions of an ancient lizard-based trading card game, terrible recipes, and a chapter on pickup artist tactics. *horribly misogynistic* They key here is that it is disconnected from modern Christianity, as admitted by the hosts. So what is this document symbolic of, what does it represent? Nothing. By presenting a religious artifact disconnected from its religion, we are able to observe a symbol with no meaning. Like an atom of antimatter, such a thing cannot exist for long, quickly becoming just an object. But in an infomercial, the meaning of the subject is presupposed. In such an environment, the hosts have to observe its meaning, it's what they're there for. We can see this document, instead of being denounced by the hosts, begins to take on its own meaning, quickly becoming an idol to be worshiped for its own sake, like some sort of metaphysical black hole.

When its meaning is self-evident, you have to accept all parts of it, because there is nothing besides the object to draw meaning from. We can observe as the hosts spin faster and faster around the collapsed symbol. *from god's mouth to your plate, i present you* At the presentation of the included recipes, you can see the hosts struggle with reconciling the supposed divine origin of these over-citrused abominations. Eventually, they acquiesce. Rev. Fryer decends into spouting pickup artist logic further into the program. *I'd like to thank our noble god* All three ignore the warnings of argon poisoning, instead opting to shower in the gas to be preserved with their prescious document.

In this program, we can observe the power of symbols in the human mind. Even divorced from greater meaning, we see this symbol accrue its' own meaning as the hosts struggle to relate to it. In the end, the camera pans out on their bodies, sacrifices to their dark god: a symbol with no meaning.


-------

I want to talk about symbols. We live in a world of symbols. And going hand in hand with those symbols, is meaning. Beneath and behind every surface in our mundane world lies the world of meaning, giving definition and purpose to every object and every event that happens to every person that ever lived. A cigar isn't just a cigar, it can mean a billion different things to a million different people. Meaning is how we construct a narrative out of everyday events and how we string those events into the story of our lives. A house, a car, a first kiss, these are the symbols of those stories, the prop pieces used in the greatest play ever made.

But is it possible for a symbol to exist with no meaning? I challenge you to think of an event, or find an object, that means nothing to you. You'll quickly find some memory, some emotion, which puts each thing into a greater context. But what about new objects, objects that you have no prior experience with? Theres always something that ties them back to you in some meaningful way. But what if that meaning isn't good enough, what if someone wants it to mean more to you. What if they want it to mean so much that you pick up that phone and make three easy payments of 39.99 so that you can make it a part of your life?

Now we've entered into the world of infomercials, where the old meaning is torn down and you are fed the new and improved meaning of these objects. This isn't a rotisserie, its your family happily eating a meal while you do less work than ever. You, as a savvy consumer, already know about rotisserie ovens, they already carry some specific meaning to you. It is the infomercial's job to sweep that all away and tell you why what you already know, which wasn't enough for you to buy a rotisserie before, is wrong, and why you need one now. An infomercial exists to construct meaning around an object, to build it up with so many layers of meaning that you'll beg that operator to take your card. Rush delivery? Yes please.

Book of Christ isn't so much an infomercial as it is a presentation, the worldwide premier of Jesus's own book, but it serves the same purpose. It's here to construct layers of meaning around something you've never heard of before. But there's a catch, something that makes this presentation different than all those other infomercials. The book of Christ is set up to have no meaning.

Let me explain. Christianity is suffused with symbols. You can certainly say it's a symbol rich religion. Every symbol points back to some unit of meaning in the religion itself. The crucifix? That's where the sins of humanity were washed away. The wine? The blood of the savior. The religion is so important to American culture that it's difficult to find anything that's not tied to it in some way. Then how can a book of the bible written by Christ himself not share in that meaning? It's simple, in the world of the infomercial.

The first job of the infomercial is to tear down your preconceived notions, or preexisting meaning, of the object at hand. When you hear the words "New book of the bible", you think two things: It's either historically connected, or spiritually connected to the pre-existing bible. You assume that there is either some compelling physical evidence showing kinship with the bible, or the contents are so metaphorically in line with the bible that it might as well be considered canon. During the course of this infomercial, we see both of these assumptions torn apart.

First, the historical claim. The origin story of the book is so convoluted and rediculous that we are forced to question the chain of evidence presented. Did this really come from the rubble of a bombed out Sbarro, or is it just a semi-elaborate forgery? Strike one. Second, the analytical claim. The hosts state that theological experts have certified this artifact genuine, but directly before this statement we are told about their mistake in certifying "Jesus's sunglasses" authentic as well. Whoever these experts are, they aren't very good at their job. Strike two.

Third, we must examine whether the document is canonical. Essentially, we would be making the argument that even without direct physical evidence, this document adds to the Christian tradition in such a way that it would be considered canonical. There are plenty of historical examples of books of the bible that check out historically and analytically, but fail in canonical relation to the bible, such as the gospel of Judas.


===============================

* Talk about broomshakalaka and how it was used as a symbol of belief.
* The book of christ starts off as implicitly divine, as opposed to broomshakalaka. Then as the commercial goes on, it becomes more mundane, opposed to broomshakalaka. But the hosts of both believe in both more. But the belief in the broomshakalaka isn't about it's miracles, it's about what it symbolizes.
* The unlikely origin story of the book, and how it is used to sow doubt in the viewer as to legitimacy.
* Anachronisms used for doubt "Dear diary", Hit and run, Pickup culture, Popodin CCG
* Additional doubt is cast on the "authenticity certification" from jesus's sunglasses
* Introduce the hosts, and how each of them has a slightly off-kilter credential
* Recipes: bible designed to be misunderstood, this has useful information. This statement shows the reliance on the physical object as the subject of belief. This brings the viewers' focus to the content of the document, and should do the same for the hosts as well. But what is the effect of the recipes being awful?
* Here we see the hosts have to come to terms with something that seems wrong about the book. We see three ways of dealing with wrong information. Rejecting it, trying to transform it, and accepting it. Only the reverend is completely supportive of the lemons.
* Also, these recipes are obsessed with lemons, it seems like this book IS a lemon.
* The more the book is knocked off of a divine pedestal, the more the hosts worship it. This is the opposite of broomshakalaka, where the power is shown as the infomercial goes on, and belief increases.
* This book is shown to be just a normal diary-esque document, with no hint of the divine. But the hosts worship and align with it like it is something more than what it is even portraying itself as. There's danger with assigning so much energy to something that doesn't have an internal connection.
* The role of the preservative argon is a metaphor which sums up the entire program. It starts off as reasonable, you would want to use argon to preserve an ancient document. But as the document becomes more and more debunked, the hosts become more and more obsessed with the argon. Then, a voice of reason, the cook, presents a first hand account of the deadliness of the argon, from Lake Nyos. The hosts reject him, at this point they are not only metaphorically, but also physically blinded by the argon. The hosts put their faith in the preservative power of argon, like they put their faith in the book of christ, and both let them down.

------------------------
In the previous video, we examined the role of belief in Broomshakalaka. Throughout the course of the video, we saw how the Broomshakalaka acts as a symbol for belief in the idea of redemption. The miraculous acts shown in the infomercial serve only as a conclusion to the process of gaining that belief, not as a reason for the belief itself. Conversely, this transformation, from mundane object into a symbol of higher meaning, is not what we see in the program about the Book of Christ. In fact, we see the opposite transformation, this book starts off as implicitly divine, and over time each part of that higher meaning is stripped away. Even so, the hosts of both programs share the process of gaining faith. It's this difference in the subject of that faith that we will be examining today.

From the beginning, the claims of the program bestow a certain amount of divinity on the Book of Christ. It's claimed that this is the only book of the bible written by Christ himself, and we go into the program to learn more about this discovery. But everything we learn casts doubt on the validity of the document, starting with the origin story. *sbarro, second intefada*

The resting place of the document being under a Sbarro pizzaria serves the distinct purpose of making the discovery as mundane as possible. If it was found in any other patch of earth, there's no telling what incredible history that part of the world might have seen. But a Sbarro is about the most lukewarm, boring location possible. *shipping magnates*

After an inglorious discovery, the document is subjected to an extremely confusing custody battle involving several Greek shipping magnates. For the audience, this serves to disrupt the chain of custody. Each new link in the chain introduces some doubt that the document is the original. But who better to answer such a question than the leading theological experts? *certified by jesus, sunglasses*

This certification, the hokey graphics notwithstanding, does nothing to assuage the doubts of the audience. Given that these experts were fooled by such an obvious forgery as Jesus's sunglasses, their certification means almost nothing. Especially considering that we are first hearing about this book in a television program instead of in some kind of scientific journal, one wonders just what kind of experts we're dealing with.

The hosts of the program each have their own problems with credentials. Prof. Edelman is currently suspended. Rev. Fryer is no ordinary pastor, but a pastor at a megachurch, which comes with it's own criticisms. Dr. Crowley is an archaeologist, but at a school of music. These three hosts don't seem up to the task of revealing the contents of a new book of the bible, and indeed they aren't. But their half baked certifications are strangely appropriate for the document we're about to examine. *unlike the bible which is meant to be misunderstood*

If you're looking for concrete and practical instructions, religion is the wrong place to go. Somehow, though, the suspended theology professor is comforted by the inclusion of some handy recipes in the book of christ. Alchemical texts have similarly specific recipes, but as Jung shows us, these procedures are symbolic only, representing the individuation process, instead of any real chemical reaction. What does a recipe for over-citrused tilapia symbolize? Maybe that this book is a lemon itself. *Maybe Jesus meant figs*

At this point we can see our hosts struggle, to varying degrees, with the discovery that Jesus's "divine" recipes have much to be desired. Dr. Crowley is plainly repulsed, Prof. Edelman tries to bargain away the dissonance, and Rev. Fryer is blindly accepting. The struggle in this scene is wholly due to the book not having a greater symbolic meaning. If the text acted as a symbol to a larger meaning, the recipe could be abstracted and understood in terms of the symbols involved. But the text is not symbolic of a larger meaning, it exists only as itself. If you want to believe in the power of the book, you also have to have faith in sugarless lemonade. *tattoo removal*

We can contrast this with the broomshakalaka. What does it mean that setting 358 is the laser tattoo removal device? It doesn't have to mean anything specifically, even though it can mean something to anyone, because the device acts as a symbol to a greater theme. Each part of it is a part of a larger whole, which gives it a context for interpretation. But the book of christ lacks this context, meaning each part of it has to be interpreted literally.

As this program has progressed, the book has been stripped of it's divine status, appearing to be little more than an offensive diary and pages of crude doodles. But the hosts' belief in it only grows as time goes on, which comes with it's own dangers. The argon used to preserve the document acts as a metaphor for the dangers of imbuing something mundane with the divine. *I want to thank our noble god* First acting as an archival preservative, the argon allows the hosts to sit near the book without damaging it. As time goes on, they identify further with the book, and request to be purified with the argon as well. *spray me too* The most reasonable person in the room, Chef Tomas, who, by the way, has the most legitimate credentials of all, being a former Vatican chef, warns them that the argon is slowly poisoning them. He tells the story of being at lake Nyos in 1986, when a cloud of carbon dioxide boiled out of the lake, killing thousands. They disregard his attempt to bring them back to reality, and he swiftly exits as the last sane person in the room. Their misplaced belief in the book continues to consume them. Jesus's digitally reconstructed cough plays a dirge while they die of argon poisoning. *Final scene of broomshakalaka* This final scene, compared with broomshakalaka, shows the danger of such misplaced belief. The Broomshakalaka fulfills the promise of making things right again, and symbolizes saving all that wasted time. But the Book of Christ symbolizes nothing, and fulfills nothing in turn.
