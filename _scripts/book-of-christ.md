Notes:
* Prof. Edelman, Rev. Fryer, Dr. Crowley, Chef Tomas
* Some of the books in the intro aren't even "great" books, like mein kampf and dianetics. Can we trust these people?
* "Dear bible, ive never told anyone this before" reads more like a diary entry.
* "Son of god, and now published author." Some of these things are way more important than the others.
* Pastor of a megachurch, suspended professor, and archaeologist at a school of music and dance
* "Much richer character than the cornball christ" Does this man even like Jesus? How can he be a professor (of theology?) (suspended) when he has such negative opinions on the religion.
* "on this live television event we reveal..." Sounds like those history channel shows where they say "we'll discover if the loch ness monster is real". It feels fake and overpromising in the same way. And you never find out anything interesting anyway.
* Everything about the book's discovery is suspect. Why was it discovered under a sbarro? Can the chain of evidence from these greek shipping magnates be trusted? Especially when people were fooled by jesus's sunglasses.
* Jesus's sunglasses show how "blind" everyone is, to be fooled by them.
* "after careful study... was found to be authentic" Study by the infomercial hosts, or people associated with the infomercial? I think so, since it is first being revealed here. This is not trustworthy.
* What is the obsession with finding new artifacts of Jesus? like the shroud of turin, why is it so important to prove it? Is it due to externalization? Maybe this is a whole commentary on people trying to find "proof", or something more?
* Noble god for noble gasses.
* Prof: "Unlike the bible designed to be misunderstood to justify abhorrent practices." Huh? Also, the book of christ is WAY worse.
* "Full of useful information", No it isn't these recipes suck.
* The chef is the person so far with the best background for this, and he was just a former vatican chef, but he's able to see that the argon is killing them.
* "I have faith that god would have wanted this much lemon" Why does he have faith in this?!?
* Why does jesus love lemons so much? The lemons are a great symbol that the new stuff is awful. Just because it's new, doesn't mean its good.
* Jesus kills someone in a hit and run, and lets his follower die for it. Why do these people want to believe in all this awful new stuff more than the old stuff.
* Jesus gets obsessed with a lizard collectible card game.
* "Jesus was writing in a different era, but even then he was considered deeply misogynistic"
* This book has so many current day events in it: hit and run's, collectible card games, pick up artists. This throws into question the authenticity of it.
* "That's just good advice" says the reverend. Then he starts talking pick up artist science. A reverend should not be talking this way.
* The chef was at lake Nyos in 1986, so he knows about gas poisoning. He's telling them what is happening, but they aren't listening to him, they are even showering in the argon. Notice the argon sprayer people have gas suits on, because they know the danger.
* "If anything we should be breathing more argon"
* "Cough not unto your hand, for it is an abomination unto god, even worse than abortion" This is another achronicity, since the bible doesn't list abortion as an atrocity.
* "Cough signature" This is exactly the kind of rediculous quasi-science that these kinds of programs use. This is crazy, science doesn't work like this.
