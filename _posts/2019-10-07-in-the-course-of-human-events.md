# Inspiration

I had a vision of a game one day, and I drew the following sketch.

![Vision Sketch](/images/itcohe-vision.jpg)

I have had a certain kind of trope on my mind lately, called [beautiful void](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulVoid). I had previously played [Looming by Gregory Weir](https://ludusnovus.net/my-games/looming/), which seemed very meaningful years ago, and had been coming up in my mind recently. Recently though, a coworker had got me the book [The Night Land, A Story Retold](https://www.amazon.com/Night-Land-Story-Retold/dp/0615508812/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), which is a rewriting of an early 1900s book which was too good for this Earth, but too badly written to be read. This book enraptured me and I now consider it to be one of my favorite books, in addition to being one of the only books in the "Horror Romance" genre. Then, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkv6rVcKKg8) came out which introduced me to the manga [Blame!](https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-30025) and the video game [NaissanceE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvmfKPtQn1E) made in its image. All of which comes together to eventually inspire this game I made.
