Now that the KDP Select exclusive period is over, I'm releasing my novelette "Erased" for free. Blurb and links below.

![Cover](/books/erased/Erased Cover.png)

An office lies at the top of a commercial building with a broken elevator, mundane in every way, as is its occupant, the startup GradeRite.
But when one of its employees discovers their system administrator, a founding member of the company, is someone nobodyâ€™s ever heard of,
it sets off a chain of events that leads to the total destruction of the company in less than a week.
