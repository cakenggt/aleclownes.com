# Let's Do Film Analysis

Outline:
1. Parenting
    1. Can't take care of either of them.
    1. Describes her just like the pupas.
    1. Extracts value from her like the pupas.
    1. Climb inside because of her small size to get the eggs.
    1. Religious dad
1. Umbilical Cord Imagery
    1. Do you want to cut it?
    1. Pupas and gems
    1. Food tubes.
    1. Shared air
1. Nature
    1. Dust
    1. Religious people vs people of the forest
1. Buried warrior
    1. Isn't a prisoner, golden jaws
    1. Umbilical cord to the green itself.
    1. Pink represents rawness of his connection to nature. He represents the antithesis of everyone else.
    1. Does it mean anything that the two people he doesn't kill are the two people who demonstrate that they can't get the gems?

* Parenting
    * Father's reliance on opiates and stimulants to sleep and wake, unnatural sleep.
    * He can't take care of her, he can't even take care of himself, since he got himself into a position where he wouldn't be able to leave the planet.
    * I could hold you in the palm of my hand. Red and angry. Like the pupas.
    * As he extracts the gem from the pupas, decapitating them, so he attempts to extract utility from his daughter (focus on useful skills instead of reading books) at the expense of her childhood and self. Plainly stated by Ezra.
    * Extends to the religious people, where the father clearly wants cee for himself, but his son is clearly her age.
    * Made her climb inside to retrieve the eggs.
* Nature
    * The green
    * Body in suit reclaimed by nature near first site.
    * Queen's lair.
    * Gem looks like amber. Looks like a fish egg or an embryo.
    * If the blister is popped.
* umbilical cord imagery
    * Do you want to cut it?
    * Radios provide for communication without contact.
    * Food tubes require partners to hook up, sustenance from the cord.
* What is in the air?
    * Life (Open wounds get infected by the dust)
    * Dust (juice cleanses the dust)
* Knife
    * Separate the blister from the pupa.
    * Disarms Ezra
* The religious people vs the people of the forest in Nausica√§
    * They have similar looking suits.
    * The people of the forest live at the mercy of nature, taking their supplies as gifts from the insects.
    * The people of the forest and the insects are revealed to both be products of the polluted world, unable to live in the clean land.
    * The religious people live apart from the green, and use juice to cleanse the dust from themselves.
    * They don't even bury their dead outside.
    * The buried warrior is the opposite, living in full communion with nature.
* Women
    * Umbilical cord imagery.
    * Made her climb inside to retrieve the eggs.
* Buried Warrior
    * Prisoner escort
    * Clearly not a prisoner, due to the golden jaws
    * Has an umbilical cord in the form of his mask, but it connects to nothing, connects to the dust filled air, the green itself.
    * Why is he pink? He is pink just like the pupas are red. He is shirtless. Maybe indicates that he is fully connected to nature in a raw way.

Points
* She listens to music, turns her headphones into receivers for another language.
* Forrested planet.
* The queen's lair is thought of as a theory, which means everyone is aware of the living nature of the orelac. The idea there should be a queen.
* The other highwayman looks like a robot, but the two of them are connected via tube.
* They have been collecting orelac, but what they really need and want is a ship off the planet.
* The man doesn't shoot the girl even after she shoots him, he only wants a kit.
* The med kit seals his wound inside the suit, as if he can't leave it. It's more important to keep the air out than to seal the wound.
* A man's work is no petty thing.
* He had no business in the green.
* He didn't tell you anything!?
* More of a utility than a partner, seems like your father chooses you the same way.
* Food packets require cooperation to hook up. Eat food through tubes.
* I was hoping you had some juice.
* It's good for you, cleanses the dust.
* She is destined to be reborn just like me. The currents have brought you here.
* When it's time to reclaim the two guns after she runs, she puts back her father's gun and only takes the highwayman's.
* Smoke or spore spewing things on the ground, maybe the adult versions of the gems.
* He finds a tent after she runs away and tries to excise the infection.
* Multiple tardigrade imagery, both on her shirt and in the tent they find.
* I'm going to miss him, my primary weapon, been with me my whole life.
    * He is now "disarmed" in a way.
* They had me climb inside the body to collect the organs because I could get the eggs out without mangling them.
    * She was used as a tool to collect eggs, a symbol of childhood.
* When I lost the book he said it was for the best. He said it was a distraction and that I was wasting my time rereading the same book.
* If you need someone to blame, blame me.
* The buried man has many golden jaws on his body. Looks very ceremonial. Air hooked up to the top of the crate.
* The mercentaries turn on music when they want to talk privately. Maybe they can talk outside of their suits and putting music on prevents others from hearing.
* They don't want to negotiate for space on their ship even though the points are meaningless if they can't get off the planet.
* Eventually it is decided to drop secondary boosters.
* To exert power over him, she turns off his air filter. She speaks a different language, as do all of the mercentaries (or at least the boss and the woman).
* Apparently it's tradition for the buried man. He is pink.
* Both the man and the girl are unable to get the gems.
* The inside of the gem capsules are corrosive if not neutralized.
* She throws the liquid into the capsule causing it to explode.
* The music is to prevent communication with the communicators. They have to scream through their suits to hear. Or maybe they switched to a different channel.
* The mercenary stabs him, but not before he gets close enough to finish her off with the kife.
* When his defences are breached, he decides to sacrifice himself for her by telling her to go.
* She runs to get first aid supplies for him, and is attacked, but the attacker is killed by a mortally wounded buried man.
* They look eye to eye with the buried man as they pass, showing that he has no air connected to his mouthpiece. Everyone else is unable to breathe the momoent that their filter is disconnected, but the buried man can be heard breathing the air noormally.
* As they are flying into space, she sees the ship above them and smiles.

* Cee
* Damon
* Ezra
* Number two
* Prisoner
